# Automate your software delivery process using continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines

## Overview

In this project, I will learn how to configure an AWS CI/CD pipeline. A pipeline allows you to automate processes in your software delivery process, such as starting automated builds and deploying to Amazon EC2 instances. I utilized AWS CodePipeline, a service that creates, tests, and delivers your code depending on the release process models I created. To choreograph each stage of your release process, use CodePipeline. I'll connect other AWS services to CodePipeline as part of your setup to complete my software delivery pipeline. 

## Individual service usage

- AWS CodePipeline
- AWS CodeDeploy
- Amazon EC2
- Amazon S3
